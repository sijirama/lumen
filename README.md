# Lumen ✨

Lumen is a witty, slightly sassy AI sidekick that lives on your desktop. It has direct access to your digital life—Obsidian, Google Calendar, Gmail, and whatever else we find interesting. 

## Installations? Simple.

**Linux & macOS**
Just run this in your terminal.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijirama/lumen/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows**
Run this in PowerShell as Administrator.
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijirama/lumen/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

## What it does
- **Obsidian**: Surgically edits your notes (Tasks, Daily Notes, etc.).
- **Google**: Manages your Calendar, Gmail, and Tasks.
- **Vision**: "Sees" your screen when you need it to.
